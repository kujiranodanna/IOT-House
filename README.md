Check the temperature of the room and drive the cooler on the go.

If you decide it's dark outside in the evening, turn on the lights in the entrance and room.

You will be notified by email and phone (Wan Gi) when a fire detector reports.

If it is judged that the outside air humidity is low and the underfloor exchange humidity is high, the underfloor ventilation fan is operated intermittently.

After playing with Raspberry Pi, let's practice home appliances and home security with IOT House.
