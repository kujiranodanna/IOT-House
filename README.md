We are developing home appliance automation, crime prevention, disaster prevention, and voice control systems.

IOT-House's IOT is an input and output technology, of course IOT is also the Internet of Things.

Many functions of IOT-House can be operated even in an environment without the Internet.

Check the temperature of the room and drive the cooler on the go.

If you decide it's dark outside in the evening, turn on the lights in the entrance and room.

If it is judged that the humidity is low outside before dawn, water the kitchen garden.

We will inform you by photo email when the security sensor works.

Play music at a fixed time.

You will be notified by email and phone (Wan Gi) when a fire detector reports.

If it is judged that the outside air humidity is low and the underfloor exchange humidity is high, the underfloor ventilation fan is operated intermittently.

After playing with Raspberry Pi, let's practice home appliances and home security with IOT House.
