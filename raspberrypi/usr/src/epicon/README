Installation
1) Detailed instructions are in the file after
   INSTALL which you should read.In brief, the following should
   work on most systems:

5)before running epicon
  If a thing to prepare for is said, the rest is the skill which
  can cook router connected to the cable.

6)after running epicon
  This software may still keep containing many bugs by the 
  un-maturity.
  There probably are some, but I don't know what they are yet.
  It  is lucky if I can have a report and advice by mail if a bug
  is found.
  If possible, send in patches such that the patch  program  will
  apply them.
  Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs.
  The  thing that the version of epicon which if you have is won-
  derful changes mine.

7)Known bug
  Any file transfers other than automatic reception of ZMODEM
  binary mode not supported.(TCP/IP)
